# Use of Application
NASA capture is the quid essential app to understanding the cosmos at its finest.
The application will utilize two different NASA API's to identify and understand 
the world and universe as it is. Much of the information we receive from far off
distances, the information comes in waves. The idea of the application is to understand
receiving data in waves and comprehending the real information.

## Manipulators:

APOD: Astronomy Picture of the Day:

*Loads up the Picture of the Day:*<br>
Can search dates for new pictures
Also Previous,Next Days (I skip to the 28 to deal with Febuarary (small fix))

*DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC):*<br>
Loads up the 11 assortment of pictures capture by EPIC passing Earth
Also Previous,Next Pictures

*Hubble Space Telescope:*<br>
Loads up a default hubble picture
Can search a numeric ID for a new picture (they go up to like 2000 its crazy!)

## Data:

*Datasets:*

Datasets are any analytical data you see from the observed application.
Any data is allowed an welcome to be experiemented on and tested

*Notesets:*

Notesets are where the user can add note data into the application to 

# APIs:
NASA capture uses the NASA APOD (picture of the day) and the DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) <br>

In addition I added the Hubble Space Telescope
<br>

# My Thought Process
All three data image centers are capturing systems that utilize old and new technology to observe the universe.
The capture part will be parsing different images together to make your own observations on the biosphere and the surrounding 
universe. With this information, you can manipulate the information and edit the dates of observed information to get
a better understanding of what you would like or interested in seeing.

The query might not be what you want, but this is the cosmos at its finest. Data is not finite or definitive,
data is real and only good observations are accepted. This is through reoccurring tests and edit the 
experiment variables.
